 * To better manage the viewing process, I'm thinking of having the video restart every 90 mins,
 * so we can indicate exact start times for the audience to anticipate.
 *
 * This means the video will restart at 11:00 (opening time), 12:30, 14:00, 15:30, 17:00,
 * 18:30 (exhibition closes at 19:00).
 *
 * This also means we need to add a 15-min countdown after the video ends,
 * which will run until the video restarts.
 *
 * Itâ€™ll be just 9:45 to 21:00 everyday.
