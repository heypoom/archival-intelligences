 * To better manage the viewing process, I'm thinking of having the video restart every 90 mins,
 * so we can indicate exact start times for the audience to anticipate.
 *
 * This means the video will restart at 11:00 (opening time), 12:15, 13:30, 14:45, 16:00,
 * 17:15, 18:30, 19:45 (exhibition closes at 21:00).
 *
 * This also means we need to add a 15-min countdown after the video ends,
 * which will run until the video restarts.
 *
 * Itâ€™ll be just 9:45 to 21:00 everyday.
