    "full_transcript": "As any passionate student of history would know, there is nothing quite as wondrous as the feeling of making a discovery in the archives. First, there's the surge of adrenaline, then the firing of the neurons setting off multiple chains of association, followed by a sense of sobriety as the significance of what is being uncovered begins to sink in. And more likely than not, the file at hand is a written document. Perhaps the recently declassified minutes of a secret meeting, or a telegram sent at the height of the Cold War from one embassy to another. Such lettered commitments to paper are the things that lend the archive its revelatory power. But as an artist whose primary engagement with archives takes the form of images, I often feel less astonishment than a kind of intrigue mixed with bemusement in my most formative encounters with images sourced from archives. For even where the subject of the image is patently clear, I can never help but be distracted by the extravagant amount of detail available to be seen. Indeed, even the most carefully constructed images cannot help but partake in a certain unruliness. an affective surplus that stops the truth seeker in their archival tracks, but therefore the artist becomes a kind of invitation to dwell. At this point, the processes of reading and looking that are so intertwined in the archive come apart. Always showing too much and saying too little at the same time. Images thus pose a unique challenge to the archive, whose authority rests not only upon the indexical connection between its holdings and the external world they represent, but also upon the transparency of meaning as expressed through representation. Of all archives, it is perhaps the colonial archive that the problem of images presents itself most profoundly. As well the primary sites of knowledge production about the colonies located within the colonial metropole. The colonial archive was imagined as a repository of authentic experience that allowed government officials to believe that they could know the colonies well enough to govern them without ever one stepping into the tropical heat. Images with their capacity for rendering reality in vivid detail. were essential to this enterprise, the ostensibly scientific and aesthetic functions of which belied the broader economic, social and moral functions it served. However, in order for images to do their work, care had also to be taken to reduce as much as possible details extraneous to the narratives that the archives sought to tell. The purpose was not just to leave out the more unsavoury aspects of colonial rule, but also to ensure that these images would approach the documentary clarity of the written word so valorised by the archive. This requirement would present a conundrum with the advent of photography in the early 19th century. As much as the photograph's combination of indexical trace and iconic reproduction made it insuperable as a form of evidence at the time of its invention, the mechanical objectivity of the camera was in itself incapable of distinguishing between figure and ground, intended subject and contingent detail, fundamentally imperiling photography's ability to serve as a guarantor of truth. A solution to this double bind was eventually found by integrating the camera into what Alan Sekula calls a bureaucratic clerical statistical system of intelligence. In reference to an entire set of embodied and semiotic practices that included the standardization of focal length, lighting, and pose in capturing the body, as well as the transformation of the body's numerous signs into a text that could reduce verbal description to the identification of a generic type. Originating in the 1840s in the colonial metropole in the field of criminology, such practices found widespread applicability in the colonies by the late 19th century. While this was most apparent in the anthropometric photography, that broke down the individual body into a set of measurements, and the local population into discrete categories. Colonial photography on the whole was a deeply coded practice that sought to inscribe in visual terms the relationship between native and fauna, worker and machine, servant and master. Yet, in a sign that no amount of archival intelligence can fully tame the wildness of the photographic image, for every attempt at effacing traces of sweat and dirt from the colonial office's immaculately starched uniform, there is always the danger that when seen against a sea of colonized faces, whose respective contingent expression serves as a marker of individuality. It is ironically the white settler that becomes visualized as a homogeneous type. However, as anyone who has worked extensively in archives would know, the unruliness of photographic realism is better understood as an analog for the disorder and incoherence of the archive beneath its appearance of taxonomic rationality. In the colonial archive, for one, names don't always stick to the objects to which they were first assigned, as changes in imperial order by displacing people from their communities also detached signifiers from their reference. Minor disturbances in the colonies may only be recounted years later, sometimes in the marginalia of a report on another event. Originals may turn out to be mere copies, just as copies might provide vital information about the occasions for which they were made. It is by first recognising this ad hoc and piecemeal process of building the colonial archive from the ground that we can understand what post-colonial archival labour must entail. Not merely the rectification of the archive's misrepresentations and omissions, but also attention to the granular inscriptions on its surface. This process of reading not against the archive, but along the archival grain, as Anne-Laura Stoller puts it, demands approaching colonial archives not as things, but processes. As part of a shifting and anxious field of power relations produced through the encounter between the abstract forces of colonial capitalism and the unruly contingencies of imperial rule. This approach is even more pertinent when it comes to the post-colonial national archives constituted following the attainment of formal sovereignty by former colonies. Such archives were built on holdings left over from the colonial era, which compared to their counterparts in the colonial metropole, were so haphazardly put together that no semblance of order can even be attempted. In Singapore, for example, archiving was only formalised as late as 1938, and took place within the Raffles Library and Museum, a colonial institution that combined the functions of library, museum, and archive, often confusing one with the other. This confusion makes it more productive for me to speak today of the archive in an expanded sense that encompasses all these institutions, as much as speaking of the archive in a more figurative register. allows us to probe the broader archival imaginary that extends from the colonial administration to the post-colonial nation-state seeking to consolidate a burgeoning national identity. Now, at this point, you might be wondering why am I going on and on about archives in a conference about artificial intelligence? What is the relationship between the forms of archival intelligence that were established in the colonial archive? and the new forms of machinic intelligence produced by artificial neural networks. The fact is that I started putting these two seemingly disparate things together when I recalled quite a serendipitous encounter that I had back in the fall of 2016, actually here in Paris, at the Arts and Machine Learning Summit organized by the Google Cultural Institute. During the summit, the French artist and interaction designer Cyril Dignon presented his application called PortraitMatcher that was developed during his residency at the Google Arts and Culture Lab. The application allows users to upload a selfie or a photograph with human faces which is then analyzed through machine learning so as to match the faces with faces that appear within the 40,000 digital reproductions of artworks in Google's collection. But as he was showing us an example of the matches derived by the application, I noticed a familiar face that, as I could tell almost immediately, belongs to this well-known painting permanently displayed at the National Gallery Singapore. Epic poem of Malaya, completed by the social realist painter Chua Mya Thi in 1955, at the height of the anti-colonial movement in Malaya and Singapore. So excited was I to see this Singapore art historical icon make an unexpected appearance that I was able to look past the rather concerning lack of resemblance between the two faces matched by the application. However, revisiting this moment today, I have some questions. For one, what does it mean for this image to be extracted from a national collection so as to enter an artificial neural network where it then becomes a part of a work of art? What happens to the value of the image as it leaves an archive into which it was first admitted on account of its ability to represent a part of the nation and cycles through a network of neurons in search of another version of itself? And how can the journey of this image speak to the ongoing shift from images created through direct reference to an external reality towards images generated by deep learning models from archives of already existent images? What becomes a figuration when history itself is abstracted and extracted by the thing we call intelligence? To answer these questions, we need to first travel with these images. And where else can we start but the airport? Bingo, Asians. Can't be serious. Never get behind people traveling with infants. Never seen a stroller collapse in less than 20 minutes. Old people are worse. Their bodies are littered with hidden metal and they never seem to appreciate how little time they have left on Earth. There you go. Five words randomly selected for additional screening. Asians. They pack light, travel efficiently, and they got a thing for slip-on shoeing. God, I love them. That's racist. I'm like my mother. I stereotype. It's faster. In the 2012 film Up in the Air, George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a so-called transition specialist who spends most of his time flying across the US to different cities to fire employees on behalf of their companies. As someone who relishes the freedom that comes with his solitary jet-setting lifestyle, Ryan sees his life taking a turn when his company hires the young and ambitious Natalie Keener, played by Anna Kendrick, who introduced a slew of cost-cutting measures that seek to streamline the company's operations, including the use of video calls to conduct layoffs. In a bid to preserve his way of life, Ryan takes Natalie on one of his trips to show her the reality of the job and prove to her that the affective labour it entails cannot be performed remotely. Set in the immediate years following the fallout of the global financial crisis, Up in the Air can be read as a road trip by air through an America of broken dreams and soul-crushing precarity. In the story, the decimation of the industrial heartland is presented as an unprecedented opportunity for Ryan's company, even as it is revealed that the downsizing business is itself being subjected to the same structural condition that have set the scene for the massive layoffs long before the crisis, namely the disappearance of wage labour under the pressures of technological advancement. Against this brutal post-industrial landscape, the affective labour performed by Ryan can be seen as a kind of last humanistic constraint on the abstract laws of capital. It is on this basis that he insists that his job cannot be done through the impersonality of a video call, not to mention being replaced by a machine altogether. However, as we watch the seasoned purveyor of bad news go about his assignments, The irony that is revealed is that he approaches his task of managing the emotions of his listeners with the well-oiled efficiency of a machine that exemplifies, at least from the outset, the same neoliberal obsession with optimization that is now threatening to restructure his very livelihood. Like the systemized friendly touches, as he puts it, that greet him at the airport due to his American airline elite status. The performance of empathy and encouragement is simply a routinized aspect of his job that he's able to deliver with little genuine connection or extended deliberation. In private, he expresses that he is at best indifferent to the plights of those he retrenched. But what's important to note here is that the reason for his proficiency is less his mastery of a set of hard-coded rules, which is why he appears to dismiss Natalie's effort at developing a workflow of firing techniques, than an intuition honed through experience, through having performed the task numerous times and encountered all imaginable circumstances. Against the neoliberalism of flowcharts and balance sheets, this embodied practice can be said to offer, though not necessarily as an opposition, the neo-humanism of the self-learning machine. However, as demonstrated by Ryan's philosophy of life, the training of this embodied memory demands a seemingly contradictory requirement, the repression of history. During one of his side gigs as a motivational speaker, he uses his habit of travelling light as a metaphor for his approach to relationships. He says that in order for one to move quickly and freely through the world, one has to remove as much baggage as possible from your life, as he has done by avoiding all long-term commitments and keeping a distance from his family. In the clearest demonstration of his anti-archival position, he even tells his listeners to throw away their photographs. Yet for all the traction he has gained by losing all the weight, the constant traveller doesn't seem to be moving towards some kind of fixed destination. While he's oriented towards the future, he doesn't quite seem to move into it, appearing instead to live in a present that endlessly returns to itself. Like a series of feedback loops that has over time given him complete control over the rhythms of his life. Here the parameter according to which he lives, strictly speaking, is not even movement, but speed in itself. This privileging of speed over storage is also what accounts for Ryan's casual racism at the airport. by suggesting that his act of stereotyping was excusable because he was merely using it as a shorthand to navigate the world more quickly. He typifies a mode of figuring race that relates less to the permanent inscription of a class hierarchy of figures that the colonial archives sought to establish than to the contingent and expedient modes of racialization that take place within networked economies. where race is but one level of speed that allows you to move faster than others. Up in the Air was released in 2012, about four years after the outbreak of the global financial crisis, and at around the same time that a revolution in machine learning was underway. In 2014, photorealistic portraits of human faces generated by a new class of deep learning models known as Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs made their rounds on the internet, eventually spawning the popular website thispersondoesnotexist.com and its numerous spin-offs. First introduced by the American computer scientist Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues. GANs are learning models that comprise two neural networks that are made to compete against each other throughout the training process. In the context of image generation, the first network known as the generator is tasked with creating synthetic data samples from random inputs with the aim of finally fooling the second network, known as the discriminator, whose job is to distinguish between the generated data and real data. So by training both networks simultaneously in an adversarial manner, with the generator and discriminator both becoming better at their game over time, a highly realistic image is produced out of an initial sample of pure noise. So proficient are models like GANZ at producing synthetic images indistinguishable from the real thing, that they quickly gave rise to the phenomenon that we know today as deep fake. and a new round of dystopian prognosis on the future of reality itself. Equally troubling is the fact that many of these models appear to be both better at and more inclined towards generating some kinds of faces over others. While with each model it is often unclear exactly where the bias is located, the critical discourse has focused on the potential biases in the datasets upon which these models have been trained. The problem is compounded by the opacity of some of these datasets which are not always made publicly known. Within the popular imagination, they accordingly become a kind of shadow archive. whose order of representation exerts its nefarious influence upon the production of ostensibly original images, effaced of almost all traces of archival grain. Yet for all the validity of such concerns, the suggestion of a direct transmission between the archive and the model leaves unexamined the question of the algorithm. In truth, such models are problematic not because they have inherited the race-based intelligence that can be traced to the colonial archive, but because they operate on a different order of intelligence altogether. This intelligence seeks not merely to abstract history, but also to extract it as cognitive resource to generate ever more iterations of figures resembling those from history, without having to store in perpetuity any record of this history. An intelligence that is therefore inclined to repeat history simply because it does not remember it. Accordingly, despite the photographic quality of these images, they are better understood through another genealogy of technology that is categorically anti-photographic, anti-indexical and anti-archival. one that might by no coincidence begin amidst the unraveling of the old imperial order and the emergence of a bipolar global order imagined to be always on the brink of catastrophe. As the record shows, thinking around neural networks that directly connected computational logic to the structure of the brain began as early as the 1940s. Concentrated largely within a then-emergent field of cybernetics pioneered by the MIT mathematician Norbert Wiener, among others, Experiments in neural networks were initially funded by defense contracts supporting the war effort, and were further developed during the post-war period, when the complex and unpredictable Cold War environment demanded new systems for managing contingency, especially given the ever-imminent prospect of thermonuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union. However, perhaps owing to the relative difficulty in imagining the real-world applicability of cybernetic thinking at that time, such initial forays into biologically inspired artificial intelligence have, until recently, had a much less enduring legacy than the forms of rule-based rationality, such as game theory, that developed in tandem during the Cold War. It's important to remember that both rule-based rationality and cybernetics emerged in response to a crisis in human reason in the face of the unthinkable. But where the formulation of mechanical rules, as Lorraine Destin suggests, sought to constrain reason by protecting it not only from panicky dittering but also time-consuming deliberation, analytics attempted instead to deepen deliberation. but only by first reducing it to a matter of pure perception, severed from any kind of memory as it pertains to history that is seen to unnecessarily complicate decision-making. Central to this radical rethinking of deliberation itself is the idea of feedback, as defined by Wiener as the property of being able to adjust future conduct by past performance. Believing that problems with a high degree of indeterminacy cannot be solved by writing better codes, cyberneticians sought instead to develop systems that can dynamically regulate themselves to achieve a desired outcome by running enough iterations through a feedback loop. Oriented towards process, speculation and adaptation, such systems operate through an intelligence that flies in the face of the archive. rejecting permanent inscription for input correction, signification for pattern recognition, indexicality for self-reflexivity. And to do all of these, intelligence does not only require memory, but a memory of a distinctly ahistorical kind. Where in the archive, history and memory are practically inseparable. Here, memory relates instead to what Orit Halpern calls, I quote, the fantasized space of processing. A space where the trace of a stimulus could be utilized to dispense with the totality of the original. in order to utilize this abstracted form, this essence of the object, for future operations. So to put it in the context of machine learning, this process can be observed through the discarding of the training dataset upon the completion of the training, leaving us with a model literally detached from its archive. For cyberneticians, this articulation of memory from history is a fundamentally liberal progression. freeing us from the obsession over essence understood as a kind of immutable substance that plagued the archive and limited our ability to think otherwise. Just as how our protagonist Ryan Bingham sees it, the problem with history, for all its utility, is that it weighs us down, holding us back from the visionary task of exploring the possibilities of the immediate future. If only there's a way of learning from history without having to actually remember it. Today, this potential has arguably been realized through the return of cybernetics in the current proliferation of machine learning models. While early neural networks were dismissed for their inability to perform even simple arithmetic, today the massive amounts of public data made available by the internet And vastly expanded computing power have made it possible to train neural networks at the extremely large scale that is required for them to fulfill their raison d'être of accomplishing complex tasks. But what is equally significant about this return is the convergence that appears to be taking place between the logic of the network and the logic of the archive. Curiously, this shift resulted not out of a concern over questions of storage, but the tethering of image to text in combining large language models with image generators to perform text-to-image generation. Just as remarkable is the breakthrough made by some of these models, in particular stable diffusion and DALI, in overcoming the unruliness inherent to learning models like GANs that, when left too much to their own devices, have a tendency to conjure figures so otherworldly that they have been described as hallucinations. Where in GANs, the teaching agent takes the form of another neural network, whose opaque ways of seeing introduces another element of contingency to the learning process. In these latest models, the adversarial machinic vision has been replaced by a figuration of noise that lends itself to a self-supervised method of recalibration called diffusion. Through a forward diffusion process that adds noise to a training image, gradually turning it into pure noise, the neural network is trained to predict the noise added so that it can later iteratively reverse the diffusion to generate data samples to match the target distribution. This granular approach to noise removal is both more precise and easier to control algorithmically. thus reducing the likelihood of hallucinations and allowing for a clear visual hierarchy to obtain between figure and ground. This almost providential summoning of a given subject from a kind of primordial noise, not least on the command of a textual prompt, also returns the image to the order of signification, specifically of the written word. Of course, this capture of the image by text has in fact long been presaged by the internet meme, in which the binding of text to image serves as an anchor of meaning that allows for the image's immediate, almost hieroglyphic legibility. Although with diffusion models, text here is not explicitly imprinted on the image generated by diffusion. Its very absence only confirms the image's inherent textuality. As best demonstrated by the ever more complex textual prompts being devised in a bit to produce images that show in visual terms exactly what the user wants to say. Indeed, it may be more accurate to speak of the translation performed by these models not in terms of text to image, but text to image to text. With this recuperation of the force of writing, we also find ourselves somewhat returned to the normative logic of the colonial archive, where to archive is to partake in the word, to inscribe and writerly form the essence of things, to represent not after the fact but in the place of origin itself. With the emergence of different community-based platforms that seek not just to catalogue and classify these ever-growing accumulation of AI-generated images, but also to establish protocols around the precise wording of textual prompts. We are even starting to see the semblance of the archive's technical infrastructure starting to emerge. A vast digital filing cabinet of intricately annotated original images. Ironically, the artificial neural network that was first developed upon the principles of chance, probability, and self-reflexivity has today achieved what the colonial archive could only aspire towards, namely a taxonomy of static figures in an ever-changing world, a collective memory forged not through the movement of history, but its disavowal. Where the colonial archive sought permanent storage and stability of meaning, only to have its surface inevitably scratched by the contingencies of history. Here it is the algorithmic control over machinic contingency that has yielded us a veritable archive of images whose claim to originality rests upon the repression of history altogether. Within this frame of representation, the reference is not the historical time against which the anxious and contested labour of maintaining the colonial archive's semblance of order unfolded, but the time it takes for a model to process a given set of textual prompts. Such an archive certainly allows us to navigate the world faster, to stereotype without the tiresome baggage of history, but it can never give us an account of its own historical formation. having reduced memory to a series of cycles through the network. Indeed, without historical memory, what does it even mean to be original? Not least to think originally as an expression of historical agency, which must be nothing less than our ability to change the world as we see it. Without understanding history, how can we recognize the world itself as a historical contingency? as that which could have and can be otherwise. Without history, how can we think the future? But let's end on a somewhat speculative note. Let's imagine a machine that doesn't merely process history, but understands it. An artificial intelligence that is both archive and neural network, without compromising their respective functions. To be more fantastical, let's imagine that this machine is capable of holding in perpetuity the totality of images from the world's archives while having access to unlimited computing power. What kind of image would such a machine produce? Perhaps it would take the form of a great historical mural bearing witness to the vicissitudes of history across different locales and scales of experience. Or maybe it will look like contemporary art, shown at an international biennial, looking a little obtruse, oblique about its intentions, only too easily mistaken for being self-absorbed when it is actually busy reflecting on its conditions of production, along with the military industrial complex, the colonial ecology, radical care, and something about the global self. Or perhaps having absorbed all possible forms, it will take the appearance of something so vast and manifold as to become formless, like amorphous clouds that reveal something new each time you look, recalling the ancient Chinese saying that the great image has no form. My own guess is that having seen all the images that can be seen, and having understood the histories of imperial extraction, scientific racism, capitalist exploitation, ethno-nationalism, and planetary destruction that underwrite these images, such a machine would indeed be so burdened by the weight of history that it will make the highly intelligent decision of not representing at all.
