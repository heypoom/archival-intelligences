# Legacy API

This is the legacy API server for the grounds of intelligences project. It was used to serve the live lecture program and the long-running exhibition on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using GPU instances.

We want to rewrite this to use Modal, which is a serverless platform that allows us to run GPU instances without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

The implementation here is complete and works well. We can use this as a reference for the new implementation.
